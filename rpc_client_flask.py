"""
This is a simple example on how to use Flask and Asynchronous RPC calls.
I kept this simple, but if you want to use this properly you will need
to expand the concept.
Things that are not included in this example.
    - Reconnection strategy.
    - Closing or re-opening the connection.
        - Keep in mind that anything you want to open or close the connection,
          you should first lock it.
            with self.internal_lock
                self.channel.stop_consuming()
                self.connection.close()
        - You also need to stop the process loop if you are intentionally
          closing the connection.
    - Consider implementing utility functionality for checking and getting
      responses.
        def has_response(correlation_id)
        def get_response(correlation_id)
Apache/wsgi configuration.
    - Each process you start with apache will create a new connection to
      RabbitMQ.
    - I would recommend depending on the size of the payload that you have
      about 100 threads per process. If the payload is larger, it might be
      worth to keep a lower thread count per process.
